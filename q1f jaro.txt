GROUP 1 - RASPBERRY PI 3 MODEL 13

Why is it Functional?

It is functional because the installed OS is fully functional with no bugs or errors during the startup
of the OS. Furthermore, the cables and accesories used for communication between the critical parts
for functionality is working properly.

During the first try, it couldn't function so they installed an operating system. Then screen went blank
and it was because of the unstable flow of current.

If the LED is blinking red, the supply doesn't meet the system requirements for required for the
source of RPi. If the LED blinks green and goes for a steady red afterwards, it is working properly.
